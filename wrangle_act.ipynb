The ratings of these dogs as seen int the Twitter account almost always have a denominator of 10 while the nemurator has rating mostly above 10. At the end of this project I hope to pose and answer some questions regarding the datasets worked with and draw some insights from such answers."

    "From the two charts above there is a clear positive corelation between the Dog stage and the number of likes and retweets a certain tweet gets. Puppo got more likes and retweets and this would infer that people like the teenage version of dogs the most. I will suspect that is because at this stage they are not too needy and also do not cause too much trouble. while pupper got leat likes and retweets and this could be due to the fact that these are smaller dogs and are more difficult to deal with. Floofer understandly got highest retweets on the second chart, this however doesnt change the fact that Puppo is also the most retweeted dog stage. This is because floofer simply means furry dogs. "
